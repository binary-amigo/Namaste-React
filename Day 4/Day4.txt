Day 4

1. What is Babel?
-

2. What are polyfills?
- Modern JS is converted into older versions for compatibility.

3. Tree Shaking (Power of Parcel )
- Removing unwanted code.

4. What is JSX?
- "It is not HTML inside Javascript". JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write *HTML-like* markup inside a JavaScript file. 
   FB devs built JSX.
   JSX follows camelCase e.g. tabindex => tabIndex  
   JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM)  (Babel does this)

5. Name of component starts with capital letter (convention)

6. When rendering functional component we use it int HTML syntax i.e. root.render(<Header/>) while React element is used as it is e.g root.render(heading)

7. What is (XSS)Cross-Side Scripting and JSX helps us prevent it?
- 

8. What is sanitization?
- 

9. What is Component Composition(Jargon)?
- Passing components as props to other components.

10. Why do we need keys in React children?
-

11. Can JSX work without Parcel?
- JSX needs Babel cause only Babel understands it so even if Parcel is not installed and Babel is installed then JSX would work.
